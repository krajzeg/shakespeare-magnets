# shakespeare-magnets

An online multi-user fridge magnet simulator with a Shakespearian bent. It's a demonstration/test-bed of the [unison][unison] client-server sync library, and needs very little actual code thanks to it. Under the hood, the browser communicates over websockets with the server.

Written in ES6, compiled with Babel and Browserify.

# Setup

```
# npm install
# npm start
Server started on port 3000.
```
